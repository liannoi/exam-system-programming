[//]: # (Short description)

Examination project performed by me at the STEP Computer Academy.

This solution is quite simple in comparison with previous examination papers,
but with all this, multithreading is used here.

In the first project (a console application project), it was necessary to write
an application that "forever" writes "Hello world". Of course, the application
should stop when you click any button from the client. In addition,
asynchronous flows are not allowed, in which ridiculous situations arise,
since: "world Helloworld", and so on ...

In the second project, it was necessary to write a desktop application on
Windows Forms (WinForms), which would contain three ListBox and three buttons.
One button to clear all ListBox. The remaining two are functional, the first -
parallelly fills the ListBox, the second - sequentially.
